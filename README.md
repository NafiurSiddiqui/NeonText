## :bug: BUGS

---

- unpredictable behaviour, sometimes one of the font does not get render on the canvas, nor the computed style for width of the `<span class= "measurementBar-width">` based on which the measuremnt bar is changed. After while this does not happen, most noticeable upon first load. Usually appears within first 4 or 5 clicks on the font family. ðŸ˜¬
